wow, this has to be the biggest and best time of my life. Being in university means i get to be independent and have some time away from my family. My friends and I can be out till whenever we want without having parents call us to ask us where we are and why we are not home yet. To not take full advantage of this is a shame and I see many students not taking this into consideration when leaving to university and it makes me sad. They confine themselves when they should be going out and having fun. This is not nice
